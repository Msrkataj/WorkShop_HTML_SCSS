This is my first WORKSHOP during studying, to introduce one-page BestShop.
It was reproduced from program AdobeXD.
Code based from HTML and Sass.
It contains everything that was required in the project:
- responsive
- hamburger menu
- variables
- external fonts
- shadows and rounding
- styling forms
- mixins, placeholders or @media
